Notes:

1. Unicode: A 32-bit way fo presenting characters.

2. UTF-8: Unicode Transformation Format 8 Bits. A convention that compress 32 bits message into 8 bits.

3. b'': python use b'' to tell itself it works with raw bytes.

4. If you have raw bytes, you must use .decode() to get the string.

5. Sometimes python don't know how to "encode" certain string, like 你好, because python don't know
        what convention you need. You must use .encode() to get the bytes you need.
